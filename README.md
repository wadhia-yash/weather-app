# 🌩️ Weather Watch

Introducing *Weather Watch*, the app that delivers accurate weather forecasts, ensuring you’re always prepared for the day’s weather with a smile!

This task is designed to evaluate your proficiency in mobile app development, particular with React Native and TypeScript.

## Exercise

Create a mobile application using React Native that encompasses the following:

- Display the location name, current temperature and an image representation of the weather using a location of your choice when the application opens.
- Display a weekly weather forecast for the selected location.
   - Display an average temperature, rounded up.
   - Display an image that best represents the weather for the day.
- Include a search function that allows users to look up weather by a location name.
  - If there are multiple locations returned by the API, give the user an option to select one.
  - When selecting a location, the weather forecast should update.

## Resources

- Use the [Open Meteo API](https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=52.52&longitude=13.41&current=temperature_2m&hourly=temperature_2m,weather_code) to obtain a weather forecast, changing the latitude and longitude where required. Don’t use any packages related to Open Meteo when interacting with the API.
- Use the [Open Meteo Geocoding API](https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search?name=) to obtain a latitude and longitude for a given location.
- Use the helper function [getWeatherImage](./src/helpers/getWeatherImage.ts) to map between a WMO weather code coming from the Open Meteo API and an image representation of the weather.

> Note: All APIs listed above are free to use without sign up.

## Requirements

- Create a fork of this repository.
- Use React Native and TypeScript.
- Ensure the app works on iOS and Android.
- Showcase your software’s testing capabilities to ensure it meets requirements by testing:
   - One complex component.
   - One helper function.
   - One API request.
- Ensure that the entire application test suite is passing.
   - Please do not remove any tests from the current project.
- Ensure that your solution accounts for edge cases and handles unusual or unexpected scenarios effectively.
- Ensure that your code is passing TypeScript compiler and ESLint checks.
   - These jobs have already been defined in package.json.
- Don’t spend longer than 2 hours on this technical test.
- Don’t focus too much time on the visual aspects of the app, favour simple layouts and basic styling using React Native libraries over using a UI kit.

> Keep in mind that your test submission (app and tests) can be evaluated in different timezones.

## Submission

Submit a link to your forked repository with your application contents. Make sure the link is accessible.

**Happy Coding**
